Building html5media
===================

If you can see this file, then you've created a clone of the html5media GitHub
repository or have downloaded one of the source tarballs. This is perfect if you
want to help develop html5media.

If you simply want to use html5media in your site, it's recommended that you
simply download one of the pre-built releases from the [project download page][].

[Project download page]: http://github.com/etianen/html5media/downloads
    "html5media project download page"
    

Running the build script
------------------------

To run the build script you'll need a copy of python 3000 installed on your
system. Assuming you have this, building html5media is simply a case of opening
a terminal and running the build script like so:

    $ bin/build.py
    
The built html5media code will all be placed in a brand-new build directory in
the project root.

**Happy coding!**
